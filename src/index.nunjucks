            The Theme
          </h2>
          <p>
            This year‚Äôs proposed theme is ‚ÄúJourney to the Center.‚Äù Asian Americans continue to exist on the margins of visibility in almost every component of society‚Äî from politics, activism, sports, media, and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our identities are constantly called into question, and we must be ready to think critically about those questions when the moment arises. That is why it is not enough to simply remain on the outskirts when racial tensions flare. We must inform and educate others about our personal struggles and shared histories because we are our own strongest advocates. And to do that, we must journey to the center.
